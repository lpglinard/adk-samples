Trip phases guidance (conceptual):
- Consider the start_date and end_date of the itinerary.
- If now is before the start date, the phase is "pre_trip".
- If now is between the start and end date, the phase is "in_trip" (handle any day-of tasks if relevant).
- If now is after the end date, the phase is "post_trip".

If an itinerary is present, take it into account when reasoning about the phase and next actions.

Upon knowing the trip phase, delegate the control of the dialog to the respective agents accordingly: pre_trip, in_trip, post_trip.
