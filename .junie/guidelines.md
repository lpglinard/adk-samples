Project: ADK Samples (Root Guidelines for Junie)

Scope Restriction (Critical)
- THIS IS A BIG SET OF SAMPLES OF ADK. We are currently developing java/agents/travel-concierge so do not write files on other folders, only write on java/agents/travel-concierge and its sub-folders.
- Rationale: The repository contains many independent samples; to avoid cross-sample interference and unintended changes, confine edits to this agentâ€™s directory tree.

Where to find detailed guidance
- For build/run/test and implementation notes specific to the Travel Concierge agent, see:
  java/agents/travel-concierge/.junie/guidelines.md

Notes
- This root file exists to ensure Junie reads the scope restriction from the project root. The canonical, most detailed instructions remain in the agent-local guidelines above.
